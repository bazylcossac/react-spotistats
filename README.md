# SpotiStats 
**SpotiStats** is a mobile-first application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. Its purpose is to let Spotify users explore their listening statistics, including their most-played tracks and favorite artists. The app integrates with the Spotify API, so a Spotify account is required to use it.
> ⚠️ **Note (25.12.2024):** Spotify has removed some features from their Api so i had to removed them from my app to make it work again. These features are: Playing demo of song, artist related artist's.

## Features 🚀

## Why React? 🤔
I’m aware that **React** may not be the best choice for building mobile applications, as frameworks like React Native or Flutter are better suited for that purpose. However, I genuinely enjoy working with React and find it a lot of fun to create applications like this one.
